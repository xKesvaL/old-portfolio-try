# KesvaL's portfolio

Heavily inspired by [Fantinel's portfolio](https://fantinel.dev/), but remixed for my taste, with what I would consider upgrades.
I did not fork the project, I rebuilt it by hand to understand everything there is to understand, and also because I would not feel like having the legacy of saying that this website is mine if I did it.
This website will probably look a lot like his in the early stages, changing as needed and with time.
